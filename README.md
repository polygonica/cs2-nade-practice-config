# cs2-nade-practice-config
A CS2 configuration that makes practicing nade lineups easy

* Place in `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\game\csgo\cfg`
  * 🛈 Note: this is **not** `SteamLibrary\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`
* Enable the developer console (Set ⚙️ -> Game -> Game -> Enable Developer Console (~) to "YES")
* Run with `exec nade`
  * 🛈 Note: this script requires a lobby launched with the practice menu (eg: Play -> Practice -> Competitive -> Nuke), not a lobby launched via the console command (eg: `map de_nuke`) to work properly
